#tRNA code v1
Group project 2019-2020

**First version of the code to calculate equivalent tRNA abundance of each anticodon type.**

Proceed in several steps:

1. Get anticodon from probe name.
1. Manually remove initator Methionine and atypical Selenocysteine. 
1. Add together abundance of tRNA bearing the same anticodon.
1. Calculate average tRNA levels in a given tissue and analyse data.
   1. Look at fold-change in tRNA abundances in each sample compared to average in all tissues.
   1. Find average tRNA abundance in a tissue and compare again fold-change to other tissues.
   1. Analyse significance of consistent variations in tRNA levels.
